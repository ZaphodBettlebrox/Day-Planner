## Getting Started

* This application displays timeblocks for standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.) for a standard work day of the user.

* The current day and time is displayed at the top of the calendar.

* Each timeblock contains a title for the hour, an input field, and save button.

* The user can input text into the input field and then press the "save" button to save the text to the local storage. Once saved the page can be refreshed and the content will still be on the page.

* Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in a past (grey), present (red), or future (green) hour.
